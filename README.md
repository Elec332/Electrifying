Electrifying
============
Welcome to Electrifying.    
This modpack is ment to be a bit different that other packs, it does not have 3 magic mods, and it doesnt have 4 ways of ore processing. This modpack is based around 2 mods that havent been the focus of a lot of packs: namely: Buildcraft and IndustrialCraft 2. These 2 are your main Tech mods, with of course some addons for it. This pack also includes extra dungeons for the explorer, and it features Thaumcraft to give it a little touch of magic. Adventure, be a great Thaumaturge, play with robots and build factories!    
Enjoy!
